# Sablier

What is encrypted in your project, and **how long it holds**.

*Français : [README.fr.md](README.fr.md) · Scoping study: [docs/scoping.md](docs/scoping.md)*

Sablier reads a project, inventories its cryptography, and crosses that inventory
with something no tool knows: **how long each kind of data has to stay
confidential.** Out of that crossing comes the only question that matters about
post-quantum today:

> Data encrypted today with RSA or an elliptic curve, and required to stay secret
> past the expiry of those algorithms, is **already lost**. Migration protects
> what comes after it, not that data.

This is the *harvest now, decrypt later* model: an adversary captures today what
they will decrypt later. For the data concerned, the compromise date is the day
it was encrypted, not the day of the attack.

Status: **prototype**. The full scoping study — problem, prior art, admitted
limits, risk model — is in [`docs/scoping.md`](docs/scoping.md).

## Try it

```bash
make demo                                   # fixture project + report
make scan DIR=/path/to/project LANG=en      # a real project
make scan DIR=/path/to/project PDF=1        # …and a PDF alongside it
make probe HOST=example.org                 # what a server actually negotiates
make test                                   # does the risk model still discriminate?
```

Reports are available in French, English and Spanish (`--lang=fr|en|es`).

The report is a self-contained HTML file: no remote font, no script, no request.
A tool that reads where the keys are must not open a socket to render its own
output.

`--pdf=FILE` writes a PDF as well, by borrowing a Chrome or Chromium the machine
already has — the same rule as the TLS probe: use what is present, add nothing,
and say plainly when it is missing. With no browser installed, the HTML report
still prints to PDF from anywhere: it ships a print stylesheet that forces the
light palette and keeps charts, findings and the probe block off page breaks.

## Two sources, because a repository can be wrong

**Static analysis** reads what the code declares. **The probe** performs an
ordinary TLS handshake and reports what the server actually negotiates — they
disagree often enough that reporting only the first is misleading. A project with
no post-quantum cryptography anywhere in its code can already be protected by its
CDN; a project that configured everything correctly can be terminated by an
intermediary that undoes it.

```
$ make probe HOST=showmetherex.com

  negotiated protocol          TLSv1.3
  cipher suite                 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (256 bits)
  negotiated group             X25519MLKEM768
  certificate signature        ecdsa-with-SHA256
  accepted versions            TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
```

The probe only belongs against hosts you are responsible for.

## Declaring confidentiality lifetimes

Without a declaration the tool applies a default lifetime and says so. With one,
it becomes useful. See [`examples/showmetherex.json`](examples/showmetherex.json).

```json
{
  "expiry_year": 2035,
  "probe": ["example.org"],
  "domains": {
    "backups":       { "paths": ["deploy/backup.sh"], "lifetime_years": 10 },
    "public content":{ "paths": ["templates/*"],      "lifetime_years": 0 }
  }
}
```

This file is the one artefact in the project that commits people rather than
tooling. It gets read, argued over, and versioned.

## What the tool refuses to do

- **Guess.** An algorithm coming from a variable is reported as undetermined,
  with its location. A wrong inventory is worse than an incomplete one, because
  nobody checks an inventory twice.
- **Predict.** The expiry date used is the regulatory deadline (2035 by default,
  configurable), not a prophecy about when a quantum computer arrives.
- **Shout.** Strong symmetric cryptography is reported as clear, a signature is
  not treated as a leak, an `md5()` used as a cache key is filed as off-topic,
  and a declared dependency is never a red alert — it is a use to confirm.
- **Fix by itself.** Rewriting cryptography without understanding the context is
  an incident generator.
- **Leave.** No account, no upload, no telemetry, no dependency.

## What it does not see

The report prints its own blind spots, at the same size as everything else: the
cryptography of managed services, live TLS negotiation for undeclared hosts, keys
held in an HSM, and data lifetimes nobody declared.

An inventory that does not say what it failed to look at is not an inventory.

## First results

First scan on a real project (Show me the REX, ~1,900 files): 17 findings, **no
red alert** — and three lessons that changed the tool immediately.

1. Backup encryption, the most sensitive operation in the project, **is not in
   the repository**: it lives in a script on the server. Static analysis alone
   will never see what matters most unless you declare it.
2. The first version reported a `md5()` in a test and a TOTP dependency — whose
   SHA-1 is mandated by the specification — as breaks. Two false positives out of
   fifteen findings is enough to lose the reader. Hence the separation between
   *inventory* and *use*, and test code filed as off-topic.
3. The probe found what no file could say: the site already negotiates
   **X25519MLKEM768**, a hybrid post-quantum key exchange. Nothing in the
   repository mentions it.

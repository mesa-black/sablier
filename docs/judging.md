## Judging somebody else's inventory

Detectors are not where this tool can win. CycloneDX 1.6 is a published format,
several scanners emit it, and they have teams behind them. What nobody else does
is cross an inventory with **how long the data it protects has to stay secret**.
So the inventory can come from anywhere:

```bash
sablier judge cbom.json --declare=sablier.json --out=report.html
```

A CBOM produced by another scanner — in Java, Python, Go, a language this
project will never parse — comes out of that command with a domain, a lifetime
and a verdict attached to every component. The locations in the CBOM are matched
against the `paths` of your declaration exactly as a local scan would be:

```
  example-service — inventory imported from another-scanner 2.1.0, 3 locations, 5 findings

    COMPROMISED              1
    BROKEN TODAY             1
    WATCH                    2
    CLEAR                    1
```

Three things are refused on the way in, and they are what makes the import
usable rather than flattering:

- **the detection is not ours, and the report says so** — in the blind spots,
  with the name of the tool that produced it. We judge what we were handed;
  whether that scanner read the code correctly is its author's claim;
- **an algorithm this tool does not know is never guessed at.** It is counted and
  named in the report (`Components of the CBOM left unjudged … : 2 (Camellia,
  TLS)`), because an importer that silently drops what it did not understand
  manufactures exactly the false assurance this project exists to refuse;
- **the fingerprint is recomputed, never read from the file.** A CBOM that could
  assert the fingerprint of an existing acceptance would walk straight through
  the decision attached to it.

One distinction survives the trip that most inventories lose: CycloneDX records
the **primitive**, so RSA signing arrives as a signature and RSA encrypting as
key transport — and this tool treats the first as not harvestable and the second
as harvestable, which is the whole risk model.

The other direction is `--cbom=FILE`, on `scan` as well as on `judge`:

```bash
sablier scan . --cbom=cbom.json --out=report.html
```

The findings leave as CycloneDX 1.6 `cryptographic-asset` components, with the
verdict, the domain, the lifetime that produced it and the fingerprint carried
as `sablier:` properties. Two things are deliberately not written: a
`nistQuantumSecurityLevel` other than zero — zero is what a quantum computer
breaks, and claiming levels 1 to 5 for everything else would be inventing
figures — and an OID, which is never guessed. Support for cryptographic assets
is recent in the tools that consume CBOMs; if yours rejects something we emit,
that is a rule to fix and it belongs in this repository.
